The following is a preliminary class diagram for the code structure to be followed during development, focusing on character movement.

All characters will implement the "Movable" and "Collidable" interfaces, so that there is a standard way of moving characters and checking for collisions. Also, this allows us to write general code in the "AbstractController" class and re-use it for the player and enemies.

The Strategy design pattern will be used to determine how each character moves n each game update. This allows us to have a standardized way to program the movement of each character, will also being easy to fine-tune and "swap around" the behavior of the same type of enemies.
