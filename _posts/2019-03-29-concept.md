This is a very early proof of concept build to test the animal-switching mechanics. Most likely no code or assets will be used in the final deliverable.

Move with the arrow keys, jump with 'Z' and switch animals with 'X'. Free sprites available in the Unity Asset Store were used: a bunny for Clemm (double jump) and a squirrel for Ulthar (wall jump).

You may only double jump once as Clemm, however wall jumping as Ulthar will refresh your double jump.
